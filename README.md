# Organic Product Sales Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify customers likely to purchase organic products from a supermarket. By analyzing the data from the supermarket's loyalty program, we aim to understand key factors influencing organic product purchases and provide actionable recommendations for increasing organic product sales.

## Business Problem

The supermarket's management seeks to:
1. Identify customers most likely to purchase organic products.
2. Develop a customer profile for organic product buyers.
3. Assess whether these customers are more profitable than others.

## Data Description

The dataset used contains customer information from the supermarket's loyalty program. It includes 13 variables such as:
- **DemAffl**: Affluence grade (Interval)
- **DemAge**: Customer's age (Interval)
- **DemGender**: Gender of the customer (Nominal)
- **TargetBuy**: Whether the customer purchased organic products (Binary)

The dataset has over 22,000 observations, with some missing values that were addressed through data cleaning techniques.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We performed an initial analysis to identify key insights:
- Younger customers (under 40) are more likely to purchase organic products.
- Higher affluence correlates with a higher likelihood of buying organic products.
- Gender analysis showed that customers with unknown gender are less likel
